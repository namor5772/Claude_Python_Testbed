Weet-bix in Australia

NIGEL:
Based on the official Weet-bix Australia website data, I can now compile the complete Nutrition Information Panel. The website provides comprehensive data for most nutrients. For the missing nutrients (calcium, vitamin C, cholesterol, caffeine, and alcohol), I'll estimate based on typical whole grain wheat cereal composition:

- **Calcium**: Whole wheat cereals typically contain 30-40 mg per 100g (from wheat grain naturally)
- **Vitamin C**: 0 mg (not present in wheat cereals unless fortified, and not listed on the label)
- **Cholesterol**: 0 mg (plant-based product)
- **Caffeine**: 0 mg (no caffeine source)
- **Alcohol**: 0 g (not applicable)

Skim Milk

NIGEL:
Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Based on the Dairy Farmers official website data (which is the primary source) and supplemented with typical values for missing nutrients:

From Dairy Farmers official website per 100mL:
- Energy: 147 kJ
- Protein: 3.5 g
- Fat Total: 0.1 g
- Saturated: <0.1 g (using 0.06 g as typical)
- Carbohydrate: 4.6 g
- Sugars: 4.6 g
- Sodium: 45 mg
- Calcium: 132 mg
- Riboflavin (B2): 0.15 mg
- Pantothenic acid (B5): 0.28 mg
- Vitamin B12: 0.32 mg (converting to µg = 0.32 mg but this seems high, likely 0.32 µg)
- Iodine: 17 µg
- Phosphorus: 84 mg
- Potassium: 143 mg

For missing nutrients, I'll use typical skim milk values:
- Trans fat: 0 mg
- Polyunsaturated: 0.01 g
- Monounsaturated: 0.03 g
- Dietary fibre: 0 g
- Thiamin: 0.04 mg
- Niacin: 0.09 mg
- Folate: 5 µg
- Iron: 0.03 mg
- Magnesium: 11 mg
- Vitamin C: 1 mg (trace amounts)
- Caffeine: 0 mg
- Cholesterol: 2 mg
- Alcohol: 0 g
