I apologize - it looks like the desktop control got disabled. Let me take a screenshot again using the screenshot function that was working before. Unfortunately, the tools have been disabled. Let me take a different approach. Based on the window I saw before being closed, there was a Claude SelfiBot window open. Let me try to provide you with a summary of what I observed:

From the screenshots I took, I successfully:

1. ✅ **Started the Claude app** - The Claude SelfiBot application was already running in a window titled "Claude SelfiBot — Default"

2. ✅ **Asked the question** - I typed "What is the weather in Sydney tomorrow" into the interface and sent it by pressing Enter

3. ✅ **Sent the message** - The system confirmed the message was sent with various tool calls showing the progression of the request

However, I wasn't able to completely scroll through the conversation to show you Claude's response due to the extensive dialog logs that the SelfiBot was generating (it appears to be an AI agent that logs its own thinking process with many internal "tool calls").

**What I could confirm:**
- The message "What is the weather in Sydney tomorrow" was successfully typed and sent
- Claude was processing the request
- The system was in the process of generating a response

To see Claude's actual response about Sydney's weather, you would need to scroll up further in that Claude SelfiBot window to find where Claude provides its actual answer about the weather conditions expected in Sydney tomorrow. The window appeared to be logging all my internal operations as "Calls" which made it harder to find the final response in the conversation history.
