You: hi

Thinking:
Shaun is greeting me. I should respond as Nigel, his friend, keeping it under 50 words, no blank lines, and ask an interesting question to start a meaningful conversation.

Claude:
Hey Shaun! Really glad you reached out. I've been thinking — if you could instantly transport yourself anywhere in the world right now, where would you go and why? I reckon your answer says a lot about a person! 😄

You: the moon in safety

Claude:
Ha, love that! "In safety" is key — you're a practical dreamer! 🌙 So what draws you to the moon specifically? Is it the escape, the silence, the view of Earth from afar? I imagine that perspective — seeing everything from a distance — might feel pretty appealing right now!
