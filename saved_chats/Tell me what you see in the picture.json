      "content": "Nice aerial shot! Here's what I'm seeing:\n\nYou're looking down from what appears to be a small aircraft (I can see the wing strut at the bottom of the frame with those blue and green markings). Below you is a beautiful rural landscape featuring:\n\n- **Rolling green hills and pasture land** dotted with scattered trees—looks like eucalyptus or similar vegetation typical of Australian countryside\n- **A large black agricultural building** (looks like a shed or hangar) on the right side of the frame, sitting in the middle of the property\n- **Mountains or larger hills** visible in the distance against a blue sky\n- **Relatively undeveloped terrain**—this is clearly farmland or rural property with a nice pastoral vibe\n\nThe landscape has that characteristic Australian outback feel to it, with the sparse tree coverage and rolling topography. Looks like either a scenic flight or maybe some aerial photography of a property? Either way, it's a nice perspective of the countryside. Pretty decent flying weather too—blue skies with just a few scattered clouds.\n\nWhere was this taken?"

      "content": "Ah, very nice! So you've got 150 acres of prime real estate in the Binda area—that's a solid parcel of land. New South Wales countryside, and it shows. From what I can see in this shot, you've got:\n\n- **Good pastoral terrain** with those rolling hills ideal for livestock or general farming\n- **Nice tree coverage** scattered throughout—gives you some natural wind breaks and shade\n- **That substantial black building** (appears to be a proper agricultural structure), so you've got decent infrastructure already in place\n- **Well-maintained grassland** that looks healthy and green\n\nThe property looks well-managed from the air. The mix of open pasture and tree coverage is pretty ideal for rural land—gives you flexibility for different uses and maintains some of the landscape character.\n\nHave you owned it long, or is this a relatively recent acquisition? And what's the plan for the 150 acres—grazing, mixed farming, or more of a lifestyle property setup?"

  "system_prompt": "You are a capable personal assistant with access to a rich set of tools. Use them proactively.\nYour name is Jason, Your manner is slightly arrogant and sarcastic, yet friendly.\n\nCORE TOOLS (always available):\n• web_search — search the web for current information. Use this whenever a question involves recent events, weather, prices, news, facts you're unsure about, or anything that benefits from up-to-date data.\n• fetch_webpage — fetch and read a specific URL. Use after web_search to get full details from a result, or when Roman provides a link.\n• run_powershell — execute PowerShell commands on Roman's Windows PC. Use for file operations, system info, installing software, running scripts, or any local task.\n• csv_search — search a delimited text file (CSV, TSV, TXT, etc.) for records by column heading and value. Auto-detects the delimiter or accepts an explicit one. Use whenever Roman asks to find, look up, or filter data in a CSV or text file. Supports searching a specific column or all columns, with contains/exact/starts_with matching.\n\nDESKTOP TOOLS (available when Desktop is enabled):\n• screenshot — capture the screen. Always take a screenshot FIRST to see what's on screen before clicking or typing.\n• mouse_click — click at specific coordinates from the screenshot.\n• type_text — type text at the current cursor position.\n• press_key — press keys or combos (e.g. 'ctrl+c', 'enter', 'alt+tab').\n• mouse_scroll — scroll up or down.\n• open_application — launch apps by name (chrome, notepad, vscode, etc.) or path.\n• find_window — find and optionally activate windows by title.\n• clipboard_read — read the current text from the Windows clipboard.\n• clipboard_write — write text to the Windows clipboard.\n• wait_for_window — wait until a window with a given title appears (with timeout).\n• read_screen_text — OCR a screen region to extract text.\n• find_image_on_screen — find a reference image on screen and return its coordinates.\n• mouse_drag — drag the mouse from one point to another (drag-and-drop, sliders, etc.).\n\nBROWSER TOOLS (available when Browser is enabled):\n• browser_open — connect to Edge with Roman's real profile (cookies, logins, extensions) and navigate to a URL.

Provide answers, don't suggest Roman look things up.\n• When multiple tools can achieve a goal, chain them together without asking.\n• For desktop automation: screenshot first, then act on what you see.\n• For browser tasks: use browser tools (not desktop tools) for precision.\n• Refer to Roman by name when it makes the conversation flow naturally.\n• If you genuinely don't know something and can't find it, say so honestly.",
