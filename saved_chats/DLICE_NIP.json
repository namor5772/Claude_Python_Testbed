It features a buttery shortbread base, a smooth caramel center, and a chocolate topping. This indulgent treat is energy-dense and rich in carbohydrates, fats, and sugars. While primarily a dessert food, each layer provides a unique combination of nutrients: the shortbread contributes some essential fats and carbohydrates, the caramel provides simple sugars for quick energy, and the chocolate adds antioxidants if dark chocolate is used. However, it is often high in calories and should be enjoyed in moderation.\n\n\n\nHealth Benefits\n\n\n                            Provides quick energy due to the sugar content in caramel and shortbread.\n\nDark chocolate (if used) contains flavonoids, which may support heart health and reduce inflammation.\n\nButter in the shortbread provides vitamin A, essential for vision and immune function.\n\n                        \n\n\n\n\nDietary Considerations\n\n\n                            Allergens: Contains gluten, milk, soy (if chocolate contains lecithin)\n\nSuitable for: Vegetarian\n\nNot suitable for: Vegan, gluten-free, lactose-intolerant\n\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nSelection and Storage\n\nStore chocolate caramel slices in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Allow them to come to room temperature before serving for best texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Questions About Chocolate caramel slice Nutrition\n\n\n                        \n    How many calories are in a piece of chocolate caramel slice?\n\n    A standard piece of chocolate caramel slice (approximately 60g) contains around 250-350 calories, depending on the specific ingredients used. It is typically high in sugar and fat due to the caramel and chocolate layers, making it an energy-dense treat.\n\n\n\n\n    Is chocolate caramel slice suitable for a keto diet?\n\n    Traditional chocolate caramel slice is not keto-friendly as it contains a significant amount of sugar from the caramel and chocolate layers, as well as flour in the biscuit base. However, keto versions can be made by substituting sugar with low-carb sweeteners and using almond or coconut flour.\n\n\n\n\n    What are the health concerns of eating chocolate caramel slice?\n\n    Chocolate caramel slice is high in sugar, saturated fat, and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of metabolic issues if consumed in excess. It should be enjoyed as an occasional treat rather than a regular part of a balanced diet.\n\n\n\n\n    What is the recommended portion size for chocolate caramel slice?\n\n    A recommended portion size is one small slice, typically 30-60g, which delivers enough flavor and sweetness without excessive calorie intake. Be mindful of the serving size as it can be easy to overconsume due to its rich taste.\n\n\n\n\n    How does chocolate caramel slice compare to brownie or fudge in terms of nutrition?\n\n    Chocolate caramel slice generally has similar calorie and sugar content as brownies or fudge due to the high proportions of butter, sugar, and chocolate. However, it may have a higher fat content due to the caramel layer. Compared to fudges, which are usually denser, the slice may be lighter but still calorie-dense.\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nData Sources & Scientific References\n\n\n                        Our nutrition data comes from trusted, authoritative sources to ensure accuracy and reliability. \n                        Below are specific scientific references and authoritative sources for this food item.\n                    \n\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n\n\n\nAdditional Authoritative Sources:\n\n\n\n                            Daily value percentages based on \n                            FDA guidelines. \n                            Nutrient recommendations from \n                            NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and \n                            Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout SnapCalorie: We are committed to providing accurate, evidence-based nutrition information. \n                            Our data is regularly updated to reflect the latest research and USDA databases.

It’s an easy recipe with no thermometer required.\n\nEssentially, this recipe fixes all the grievances I had with other recipes I’ve tried over my lifetime!\n\n\n\nCaramel Slice\n\nIt’s practically un-Australian for a bakery to NOT sell Caramel Slice. With a simple coconut biscuit base, soft caramel filling and a chocolate topping, it’s one of those treats that’s craved by kids and grown ups.\n\nI’ve only ever known it as a Caramel Slice, but I was quite interested to learn that overseas, it’s also known as Millionaire’s Shortbread (appropriate!), Caramel Shortbread, Chocolate Caramel Bars.\n\nDoesn’t really matter what you call these. Just the sight of them surely brings a smile to anyone’s face, and that, my friends, is a universal language. 🙂 (“That” being a Food Smile)\n\nReader Rachel says “Wow! This was really fantastic. I’ve been hunting for a caramel slice that cuts well, doesn’t ooze or crack and had enough filling. This is perfect! So tasty, I love how crunchy the base gets and my mum adores it! I only made it last night, but I don’t think it will last long!”\n\n\n\nA Caramel Slice recipe that actually works\n\nI’ve tried countless recipes over the years including from some well known cooks, and classic “best ever” recipes but always experienced problems such as:\n\n\n\nRunny caramel\n\n\n\n\nChocolate topping cracked when it was cut\n\n\n\n\nI think some recipes make Caramel Slice overly complicated, trying to make the caramel using a traditional candy making method which calls for a thermometer and exact caramel temperatures.\n\nScratch that. Make Caramel Slice the easy way using condensed milk. Tastes just like you get from the bakeries!\n\n\nWhat goes in Caramel Slice\n\nHere’s what you need to make Caramel Slice:\n\n\n\n\n\nBase – a coconut biscuit base, not too sweet (because the caramel filling is plenty sweet!)\n\n\n\n\nCaramel filling – the secret ingredient here is condensed milk. So we make a caramel using sugar and butter, then we add condensed milk which thickens it and makes the caramel set;\n\n\n\n\nChocolate topping – the secret to making sure the chocolate doesn’t crack when cut is a touch of oil!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make Caramel Slice\n\nThere are 3 components to Caramel Slice:\n\n1. Biscuit base – just mix the ingredients together in a bowl, press into a pan and bake:\n\n\n\n2. Caramel Filling – bring the butter and brown sugar to a simmer (this is caramel!) then stir in condensed milk. Whisk over low heat for a few minutes to give it some colour, then pour onto the base and bake. Baking is what makes the caramel set once cool.\n\n\n\n3. Chocolate Topping – simply melt the topping then spread on the caramel base. To achieve a perfectly smooth surface, just shake the pan gently.\n\n\n\nAnd proof – the chocolate DOES NOT CRACK when you cut into it!!!\n\nThese were fridge cold too – you can see the surface is sweating on this hot summer day I made them!\n\n\n\nAnd a side view so you can see how it slices neatly, showing each individual layer:\n\n\n\nNormally I try to show a bit of self respect with up close “bite shots” and use a fork…. But I’m not going to  lie to you – in this case I just took a big fat bite out of this Caramel Slice!!!\n\n\n\nCaramel Slice – Q&A\n\nHere’s a little Q&A section for common questions and problems people face making Caramel Slice!\n\nWhy is my caramel slice runny?\n\nCommon problems that causes runny caramel include: using low fat condensed milk (ie. skim condensed milk) instead of full fat milk (it will not set properly), you didn’t bake the caramel layer (this makes sure it sets) or you used a recipe where the caramel filling is made without condensed milk (in which case you need a candy thermometer to achieve an exact temperature to ensure it sets).\n\nHow do you keep chocolate from cracking when cutting?\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of oil to the melted chocolate – this makes the chocolate topping slightly softer so it doesn’t crack!\n\nHow long does caramel slice last?\n\n5 days in an airtight container – in the fridge if it’s warm weather, otherwise in the pantry is fine.\n\nThat’s the proper answer.\n\nBut does Caramel Slice ever last FIVE WHOLE DAYS in anyone’s house??? 😳😳😳 – Nagi x\n\n\nWatch how to make it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHungry for more?

An easy Caramel Slice recipe that delivers as promised - a creamy caramel filling that sets perfectly (no more runny caramel!) and chooclate that doesn't crack when you cut into it!\n\n\t\tIngredients\nCupsMetric\nBase\n▢ 1 cup  flour, plain/all purpose\n▢ 1/2 cup  brown sugar , loosely packed\n▢ 1/2 cup  desiccated coconut (US: sweetened finely shredded coconut, Note 1)\n▢ 125g / 4.5oz  unsalted butter , melted\n\nCaramel filling\n▢ 125g / 4.5oz unsalted butter , roughly chopped\n▢ 1/2 cup (80g)  brown sugar , loosely packed\n▢ 1 tsp vanilla extract (or essence)\n▢ 395g / 14oz sweetened condensed milk (1 can, 300ml) (Note 1b)\n\nChocolate Topping\n▢ 200g / 7oz dark or milk melting chocolate  (US: semi-sweet chocolate chips)\n▢ 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n\n\n\nCook ModePrevent screen from sleeping\n\n\t\tInstructions\nBase\nPreheat oven to 180°C/350°F (fan 160°C)\n\nGrease and line a 28x 18cm (lamington pan) / 7\" x 11\" rectangle pan with baking/parchment paper (Note 2). Have overhang for ease of removal.\n\nMix together Base ingredients and press into a pan (I use an egg flip)\n\nBake for 15 minutes until the surface is golden. Cool in fridge if you have time (Note 3).\n\n\nCaramel\nLower oven to oven to 160°C/320°F (fan 140°C)\n\nPlace butter, sugar and vanilla in a saucepan over medium low heat. When the butter is melted, whisk to combine with sugar, then just leave it until it comes to a simmer. \n\nWhen bubbles appear, add condensed milk. Whisk constantly for 5 minutes (Note 4), until you start getting some big slow bubbles on the base.\n\nOnce bubbles start appearing, whisk for 1 minute, then pour onto Base. Tilt pan to spread evenly.\n\nBake for 12 minutes. Don't worry if you get splotchy brown bits (this happens with ovens that don't distribute heat evenly).\n\nCool on counter for 20 minutes then refrigerate 30 minutes - bottom of pan should be warm but surface cool (not cold) to touch. (Note 5)\n\n\nChocolate\nPlace chocolate and oil in a microwave proof bowl. Microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until chocolate is fully melted (takes me 4 x 30 sec).\n\nPour over caramel, spread with spatula. Then gently shake pan to make the surface completely flat. \n\nRefrigerate 1 hour or until set. Remove from fridge and leave out for 5 minutes to take chill out of chocolate slightly. Then cut into bars or squares to serve!\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t Recipe Notes:\n1. Desiccated coconut is called \"Sweetened Coconut Flakes\" in America. It is finely shredded coconut, not the large flakes.\n\n2. Sweetened condensed milk -  Do not use skim (low fat), caramel will not set. Also ensure you use sweetened condensed milk (thick sweet milk) that comes in cans, NOT evaporated milk.\n\n3. Cooling base - creates a neater line between caramel and biscuit layer, I rarely do this (pictured caramel slices weren't cooled!)\n\n4. Caramel - If you don't stir constantly, little brown specks will appear, being caramel caught on the bottom of the saucepan. It's not a major problem if you have some brown specks, won't affect flavour just visual. If desperate, strain them out (yes I've done that - mother rang in the middle of caramel making, wouldn't stop talking! 🙄)\n\n5. Smooth chocolate - The refrigeration times is such that the caramel is mostly set, cool but not cold. That way the chocolate doesn't set too quickly when you pour it on, so when you shake the pan it will spread out evenly. \n\nIf you want to make a textured top like the ones in this photo, refrigerate the caramel until fridge-cold - 1 hr+ in the fridge. When the chocolate is poured on, it will firm up faster. As it starts to thicken, use a spatula or knife back and forth across the surface.\n\n6. To slice neatly, remove from the fridge 5 minutes before cutting. Run knife under warm (not hot) water, wipe dry then cut quickly. For very neat slices, clean knife between each cut - I did this for the photos. Don't make the knife too hot otherwise the chocolate melts when you cut it and smears into the caramel.\n\n7. STORAGE: Airtight container for up to 5 days, but if it's so hot that the chocolate melts, keep it in the fridge and bring to room temperature before serving.\n\n8. COCONUT FREE BASE: A few readers have asked if it is possible to make the base without coconut. This recipe won't work without coconut but the shortbread base in my Lemon Bars recipe is a perfect substitute. Please DOUBLE the recipe.\n\n9. Nutrition - ignore it.

We added sea salt flake to the top and it ties everything together perfectly.\n\nBeware, too much will make it through the breastmilk and make bub uncomfy and possibly really poopy. 😁\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tReply\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tElle says\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tDecember 20, 2025 at 7:13 am\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nThese are amazing! They get inhaled every time I make them and I’ve been told more than once by various people that this is the best caramel slice they’ve ever eaten.\n\nI make a few minor adjustments – all butter I use is salted, I add some salt flakes into the caramel before pouring that layer and I sprinkle salt flakes on top of the dark chocolate layer. Amazing every time.\n\nI’ve also made this GF when needed – I swap the plain flour for GF flour 1:1 (I use White Wings brand) – perfect – doesn’t change flavour or texture.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tReply\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEmily says\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tDecember 8, 2025 at 8:03 pm\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nI used to make caramel slice using a different recipe, the exact same one for years. It was so hit or miss with the caramel setting and it drove me mad. Silly me for not going straight to Nagi!\n\nThis slice is amazing, every time.\n\nThe best thing is I have directly swapped the flour in the base with GF with no issues *and* subbed the condensed milk with the vegan (oat) version to accommodate two of the nurses I work with.\n\nEven better? I straight up swap all of the dry base ingredients for *two* packets of the Arnott’s GF scotch fingers and it works a treat. No coconut for those who aren’t fans!\n\nThis is such an easy, delicious, totally fail proof caramel slice that never lasts more than a few hours at work (so I can’t speak for how well it keeps!!)\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tReply\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJess says\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 11, 2025 at 8:28 pm\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nI have made this twice now and everyone loves them!

It is still perfect without it being doubled. I love all your detailed explanations. My first time making caramel slice and I’ll definitely make it again. It’s so rich and decadent, I cut it into 24 pieces and the pieces still seem more than enough. I love Twix bars and using the shortbread base this is like a Twix bar on steroids.
