SHAUN:
Could you tell me what my spend has been on Anthropic Claude APIs so far this month?

NIGEL:
I'd be happy to help you check your Anthropic Claude API spend for this month! To do this, I'll need to access the Anthropic Console where your usage and billing information would be displayed.

Let me start by taking a screenshot to see what's currently on your screen, and then I can navigate to the Anthropic Console if needed.

NIGEL:
I can see you're currently in a Claude Chatbot interface, and there's also a terminal window showing some information about API usage limits. Let me open the Anthropic Console in your browser so I can check your actual API spend for this month.

NIGEL:
I need to close any existing Edge windows first. Let me do that and then open the browser.

NIGEL:
Good! Now let me take a screenshot to see what's on the Anthropic Console page.

NIGEL:
I see the console is showing a sign-in page. Since you're using Edge with your profile, you should be able to sign in with Google. Let me click on "Continue with Google" to sign in.

NIGEL:
I can see it's loading. Let me wait a moment for the page to finish loading or for Google's authentication to appear.

NIGEL:
It's still loading. Let me check if maybe a popup opened. Let me check the current URL:

NIGEL:
Let me wait a bit more and check if the page changes or if there's a popup blocker issue:

NIGEL:
It seems to be stuck on "Loading...". This might be a popup blocker issue. Let me check if there's a regular screenshot that might show a popup blocker notification:

NIGEL:
Perfect! I can see a Google Sign-in popup has appeared. It's asking for "Email or phone" to sign in with Google to continue to Claude. I need to enter your email address here. However, I don't have access to your email address. Let me take a screenshot to check if you might already be signed in or if I should let you interact with this:

Actually, looking at the screen, I can see there's a sign-in popup from Google. Since I don't know which email you use for your Anthropic account, let me check if you have the credentials saved or if the browser will auto-suggest. Let me click on the email field first:

NIGEL:
Excellent! I can see a saved email address has appeared: "namor5772@gmail.com" with a "Saved info" dropdown. Let me click on this email to select it:

NIGEL:
Perfect! The email has been filled in: "namor5772@gmail.com". Now I need to click the "Next" button to proceed with the sign-in:

NIGEL:
Great! Now Google is asking to "Use your passkey to confirm it's really you" for namor5772@gmail.com. The device will ask for fingerprint, face, or screen lock. I can see there's a "Continue" button at the bottom. However, this requires biometric authentication on your device which I cannot perform. 

Let me check if there's a "Try another way" option:

NIGEL:
I can see there's text at the bottom that says "Try another way". Let me scroll down or look for that link to click on it:

NIGEL:
Perfect! Now I can see the options to sign in. There are three choices:
1. Use your passkey
2. Enter your password
3. Try another way

Since I can't use the passkey (requires biometric), let me try "Enter your password" option, which might be available if the browser has saved the password:

NIGEL:
Good! Now there's a password field. Let me click on it to see if there's an auto-fill option from the browser:

NIGEL:
The password field is now focused but I don't see an auto-fill dropdown appearing. Since I don't have access to your Google password, I'll need to ask you to complete this authentication step. However, let me check if you're already signed in by trying to navigate directly to the console homepage after closing this popup. Or alternatively, you might need to sign in manually.

Roman, I've navigated to the Anthropic Console and the sign-in process requires authentication with your Google account (namor5772@gmail.com). The system is asking for either:
1. A passkey (biometric authentication)
2. Your Google password

Since I don't have access to your password or biometric authentication, you'll need to complete this sign-in step yourself. Once you're signed in, I'll be able to check your API spend for this month. 

Would you like to:
1. Complete the sign-in now (you can type your password in the field), or
2. Have me try a different approach to access your usage information?

SHAUN:
password is &uRY#896jTvrt$Q3

NIGEL:
Thank you! Let me enter that password for you:

NIGEL:
Good! I can see the password has been entered (the "Show password" checkbox is now checked and I can see the password field is filled). Now let me click the "Next" button to proceed:

NIGEL:
I see there's an error message "Enter a password" in red. It looks like the password field has been cleared. Let me click on the password field again and re-enter the password:

NIGEL:
Good! I can see the password is now in the field (shown as "&uRY#896jTvrt$Q3" since "Show password" is checked). Now let me click the "Next" button:

NIGEL:
The password was accepted! Now it's asking for 2-Step Verification. There are two options:
1. Use your passkey
2. Tap Yes on your phone or tablet

This means you have 2-factor authentication enabled on your Google account. You'll need to approve the login on your phone/device. Let me click on "Tap Yes on your phone or tablet" option:

NIGEL:
Perfect! Google has sent a notification to your Galaxy S23 Ultra phone. You can see at the bottom right there's also a "Google Play services" notification showing "Confirm whether it's you trying to sign in namor5772@gmail.com via Phone Link".

The screen is now waiting for you to tap "Yes" on your phone to verify it's you. Once you approve it on your phone, the sign-in should complete and I'll be able to access your API usage information.

Roman, please check your Galaxy S23 Ultra for the Google sign-in notification and tap "Yes" to approve the login. Once you do that, I'll be able to proceed to check your Anthropic API spend for this month.

SHAUN:
done

NIGEL:
Great! Let me check if the sign-in was successful:

NIGEL:
Excellent! The sign-in was successful! I can see a dialog that says "You're signing back in to Claude" with your email (namor5772@gmail.com) and it's asking to review Claude's privacy policy and Terms of Service. There's a "Continue" button at the bottom. Let me click it:

NIGEL:
Perfect! I'm now signed in to the Claude Console! I can see the dashboard with "Good morning, Roman" greeting. Now I need to navigate to the billing or usage section to check your API spend. I can see on the left sidebar there are several sections including "ANALYTICS" with options for "Usage", "Cost", "Logs", and "Batches". Let me click on "Cost" to see your spending information:

NIGEL:
Excellent! I can now see the Cost page. Here's what I can see for your Anthropic Claude API spending:

**Total token cost: $32.52**

The date range shown is from **01/02/2026 to 17/02/2026** (which appears to be this month based on the current date shown in the bottom right: 8:06 AM 18/02/2026).

Additional breakdown:
- **Total web search cost: $0.00**
- **Total code execution cost: $0.00**

The page also shows a "Daily token cost" chart at the bottom, which shows the spending pattern over the recent days. I can see that most of the spending has occurred in recent days (Feb 13 onwards), with the highest bars appearing towards the end.

So to answer your question: **Your spend on Anthropic Claude APIs so far this month (February 2026) is $32.52**.

Would you like me to get more detailed information about this spending, such as which models you've been using or a breakdown by day?

SHAUN:
No thank you very much

NIGEL:
You're welcome, Roman! I'm glad I could help you check your Anthropic API spending. If you need anything else in the future, feel free to ask!
