The International System of Units (SI) recognizes the kilojoule as the standard unit for food energy, which is why it is featured on nutrition labels in many countries, including Australia and parts of Europe. Many people are more familiar with the kilocalorie (kcal), often called a “calorie,” but the two are easily converted: one kcal is approximately equal to 4.184 kJ. Understanding your individual kilojoule needs is the first step toward achieving a healthy weight, whether you aim to maintain, lose, or gain body mass.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Kilojoules as Energy Units\n\nA kilojoule represents a specific unit of work or heat energy. Since the kilojoule value is four times larger than the kilocalorie value, you will see much higher numbers on a nutrition label listing kilojoules. All food and drinks contain energy, which the body breaks down to power every biological process, from breathing and circulating blood to physical movement. If the kilojoules consumed exceed the energy expended, the surplus energy is stored in the body, primarily as fat.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Your Baseline Energy Requirement\n\nThe first step in determining your daily needs is to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which represents the minimum energy required to keep your body alive at rest. This energy is expended for involuntary functions, such as organ operation, without factoring in physical activity or food digestion. Your BMR is influenced by several biological factors, including your age, sex, weight, and height.\n\nSex plays a role because men generally have a higher BMR than women due to a greater proportion of lean muscle mass. Muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue, meaning it burns more kilojoules even while resting. Age also causes a change in BMR, as most adults experience a gradual decline in muscle mass after their 30s, which consequently slows the metabolic rate. Body weight and height are direct components of the BMR calculation because a larger body mass requires more energy simply to maintain its size and physiological functions.\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting Intake for Physical Activity and Weight Goals\n\nThe baseline BMR figure must then be adjusted using a Physical Activity Factor (PAF) to arrive at your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). The TDEE is the total number of kilojoules your body burns in a 24-hour period, and it is determined by multiplying your BMR by an activity multiplier based on your lifestyle. A sedentary lifestyle, characterized by a desk job and little to no structured exercise, uses the lowest multiplier. For example, someone who is lightly active, exercising one to three days per week, would use a lower PAF than someone who is moderately active and exercises three to five days per week.\n\nTo manage your weight, compare your TDEE to your daily kilojoule intake. Maintaining your current weight requires consuming a kilojoule count that matches your TDEE. For weight loss, you need to create a consistent energy deficit, where your intake is lower than your TDEE. A common and sustainable goal for gradual weight loss is to consume approximately 2,000 kJ less per day, which results in losing about half a kilogram of body fat per week. Conversely, weight gain requires a consistent surplus of kilojoules beyond your TDEE.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Reference Guidelines for Daily kJ Intake\n\nGeneral guidelines offer a starting point for understanding energy needs, though individual calculations provide the most accurate assessment. For maintaining a healthy weight, the average adult is often cited as needing approximately 8,700 kilojoules per day. More specific reference data suggests an average adult woman may require around 8,000 kJ per day, while an average adult man may require closer to 10,000 kJ per day. These figures are based on broad population averages and assume a moderate level of physical activity.\n\nMonitoring your intake involves checking the nutritional information panels on packaged foods, where the energy content is listed in kilojoules. Many people use mobile applications to track their daily food consumption and activity levels, which helps keep a running tally of their kilojoule intake versus expenditure. Regularly checking your weight serves as the most practical indicator of whether your current intake is aligned with your goals."

You will see the number of calories in an item listed on the packaging as \"kcal\".\nShould I keep track of calories?\nWhen we eat and drink more calories than we use, our bodies store the excess as body fat. If this continues over time, we may put on weight.\nKnowing the calorie content of food and drink – and how much we have – makes it easier to keep track of our daily intake.\nHowever, counting calories is not the only way to change how you eat to lose weight. Simple things like adjusting portion sizes and making sure your meals are made up of the right types of food can also make a big difference.\nFind out more about healthy eating when trying to lose weight.\n\n            \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n         \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n           \n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  How many calories to eat a day\nThe recommended daily calorie intake for the average person is:\n2,500kcal for men\n2,000kcal for women\nHow many calories to eat to lose weight\nWhen trying to lose weight, the average person should aim to reduce their daily calorie intake by about 600kcal.\nThat means reducing calories from the recommended daily allowance to:\n1,900kcal for men\n1,400kcal for women\n\n                \n\n              \n            \n          \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n           \n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n  \n    Remember\n\n      When having your meals, try to include:\nat least 5 portions of fruit and veg each day – a portion is 80g, though a combination of smaller amounts counts too\nat least 2 portions of fish each week (if you eat it), one of which is oily – a portion is 140g\nFind out more about healthy eating when trying to lose weight.\n\n  \n\n\n                \n\n              \n            \n          \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n           \n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  How to count calories\nBeing really precise with calorie counting can be a little tricky, but there are some general guidelines that can be useful if you want to have a better idea about how many calories you're having each day.\nHere are some simple ways to help you keep track.\n\n                \n\n              \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n        \n            \n          \n    \n\n  \n    \n    \n        Check the labels on shop-bought foods\nYou can find calorie information on food labels, usually broken down per portion, per 100g and per pack.\nPer-portion information may be more useful than per 100g, but remember that the portion size you're having might not be the same as the manufacturer's portion – this can make a big difference to your calorie intake over the day.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n              \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n        \n            \n          \n    \n\n  \n    \n    \n        Try weighing your portions\nTo begin with, it may be useful to weigh the portions you have.

      "content": "Based on the information I found, here's what you should know about minimum daily energy intake for safe weight loss:\n\n## Minimum Safe Daily Intake\n\n**For men, the minimum safe daily intake is generally:**\n- **1,500 calories (approximately 6,300 kJ)** according to general medical guidelines\n- The NHS recommends **1,900 calories (approximately 7,950 kJ)** per day for men trying to lose weight\n\n**Why these minimums matter:**\n- Going below 1,500 calories (6,300 kJ) per day for men can:\n  - Not provide sufficient nutrients\n  - Potentially slow your metabolism\n  - Make it harder to get adequate vitamins, minerals, and protein\n  - Be difficult to sustain long-term\n\n## Recommended Approach for You\n\nAt 66 years old and 89kg in generally good health, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Target range: 7,950-8,400 kJ (1,900-2,000 calories) per day** - This creates a calorie deficit for weight loss while staying above the safety threshold\n\n2. **Expected weight loss: 0.5-1 kg per week** - This is considered the safe and sustainable rate\n\n3. **Consider consulting your doctor** - Since you're 66, it's wise to discuss any dietary changes with your healthcare provider, especially to:\n   - Account for any medications you take\n   - Ensure adequate protein intake to preserve muscle mass (important as we age)\n   - Address any specific health considerations\n\n**Important:** Don't go below 6,300 kJ (1,500 calories) per day without medical supervision, as this increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies and other health issues."
