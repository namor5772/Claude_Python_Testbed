The past twelve months have been a trying time for international cooperation, as the forces of conflict and contention grew stronger and the end of the American led world order more clearly came into view. Unlike 2024, when the pageantry of the Summer Olympics and beauty of the host city Paris reminded everyone of what cooperation and collaboration can accomplish, 2025 provided few instances of inspiration. One can only hope that 2026 will surprise us in a good way. But before we jump to the new year, here are my top ten most significant world events in 2025. You may want to read what follows closely.

A case in point is the conflict that erupted in July between Cambodia and Thailand. With a population of just over 17 million, Cambodia is far smaller and militarily weaker than its neighbor Thailand, which has a population four times larger. The July fighting, the worst in decades, ostensibly was about a century-old border dispute. In particular, Cambodia and Thailand both claim ownership of Prasat Ta Muen Thom, an ancient temple perched in the forested Dangrek Mountains that divide the two countries. But complicated domestic politics on both sides of the border pushed those latent tensions into open conflict. The initial fighting killed several dozen people and displaced tens of thousands. President Donald Trump intervened and threatened to halt trade negotiations with Cambodia and Thailand unless the fighting stopped. Both sides then grudgingly agreed to a ceasefire. A formal deal was signed in late October in Kuala Lumpur on the margins of the annual ASEAN Summit. The agreement, however, did not stick. A landmine killed four Thai soldiers in November, prompting Bangkok to suspend parts of the agreement. The fighting escalated earlier this month when Thai fighter jets bombed targets in Cambodia. Thailand’s new prime minister, whose predecessor was ousted for being too conciliatory to Phnom Penh, has vowed that “if the fighting is to stop, Cambodia must follow the course of action set by Thailand.” That sounds like a recipe for continued fighting.  \n\n9. Cardinal Robert Prevost Becomes Pope Leo XIV\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had 267 popes. Until 2025, not one of them had been from North America, let alone the United States. That changed in May. On April 21, the ailing Pope Francis died suddenly after suffering a stroke. He had been pope for a dozen years. The Roman Catholic Church then entered a period it calls the interregnum, which lasts until a new pope is selected. Following time-honored tradition, the 133 cardinals eligible to participate assembled in Rome for a conclave, the formal process for selecting the next pope. The first three ballots saw black smoke emerge from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, signifying that no one had achieved the  necessary two-thirds support. Then on the fourth ballot, the smoke turned white. The conclave had selected Cardinal Robert Prevost. Born and raised on the South Side of Chicago and a graduate of Villanova University, he spent more than two decades in Peru, first doing missionary work and then as Bishop of Chiclayo. In 2023, he moved to Rome to become prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of most bishops, and was subsequently made a cardinal. Prevost became the first member of the Augustinian religious order, which was founded in 1244, to become pope. Upon being installed, he took the name Leo XIV to recall the example of Pope Leo XIII, the author of the 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum (“Revolutionary Change”) that called for improving the lot of the working class.  \n\n8.India and Pakistan Clash\n\nIn 2000, President Bill Clinton called Kashmir “the most dangerous place in the world.” The simmering tensions between India and Pakistan over the region erupted into open conflict in May, two weeks after five terrorists killed twenty-six people near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani-based terrorist organization that carried out the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack that killed 175 people, likely sponsored the Pahalgam attack. In 2008, India declined to retaliate. This time, however, it struck what it called “terrorist infrastructure” inside Pakistan. Pakistan responded with drone and missile strikes against Indian military bases and shot down two of India’s most advanced fighter jets. India in turn destroyed air defense systems around the Pakistani city of Lahore. Neither side gained a meaningful military advantage from their most intense fighting in half a century, and they agreed to a ceasefire after three days. President Donald Trump said he mediated the ceasefire, a claim that Pakistan’s Army Chief of Staff and de facto leader Asim Munir supported and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected. The immediate consequence of the fighting was a rift in U.S.-Indian relations, as Trump slapped steep tariffs on Indian exports partly in retaliation for Modi’s refusal to acknowledge his mediation efforts. But the underlying animus between India and Pakistan remains. One open issue is whether India’s decision to suspend its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 means it will curtail the flow of water in the Indus River system that supplies 80 percent of Pakistani farms.  \n\n7. The AI Race Intensifies\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said of artificial intelligence (AI) back in 2017 that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” History may prove him wrong, but for now, countries are acting as if he might be right. The United States and China are the world’s two leading AI powers, and no one else is close. The Chinese firm DeepSeek captured global attention in January when it released an AI model that matched the best U.S. AI models without using advanced Nvidia chips that had been seen as essential to cutting-edge AI operations. Experts challenged DeepSeek’s claims, but U.S. firms took them as reason to double down on their own AI investments. The importance of chips in AI development fueled the Trump administration’s initial decision to continue and then expand the restrictions the Biden administration placed on the export of advanced semiconductors made in the United States or with U.S. technology. Two weeks ago, however, Trump reversed course and authorized Nvidia to sell its powerful H200 chip to China. The decision triggered biting criticism that he was endangering U.S. national security. Lost in this debate is the fact that the AI race is not just about which country builds the best models but also who does a better job integrating AI into everyday operations. Here China may have the advantage. Meanwhile, critics ask whether AI might turn into an epic bust that shocks the economy or an epic success that erases jobs.  \n\n6. Sudan’s Grueling Civil War Continues\n\n“Hell on Earth” may be the best description of Sudan’s nearly three-year long civil war. The fighting pits the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo. The two men seized power in a coup in October 2021 but eventually had a falling out. Neither side has won a decisive breakthrough, and fighting continues across multiple fronts. The SAF governs from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, controls the major cities in the east and north, and is recognized as Sudan’s legitimate government. Meanwhile, the RSF controls most of Darfur and other areas in central and western Sudan. Each side has foreign backers, with Egypt, Russia, and Turkey among the countries supporting the SAF and Chad, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates among those supporting the RSF. The war’s human cost has been staggering. As many as 400,000 people have died and more than twelve million have been displaced. Much of the country faces famine, and the demand for humanitarian aid far outpaces available resources. The fighting was particularly gruesome in the city of El Fasher, the last SAF stronghold in Darfur, which the RSF took in October after an eighteen-month siege. The blood and bodies from the resulting slaughter of the city’s inhabitants could be seen from space. The prospects for a mediated end to the civil war remain dim, and the country’s de facto partition is a possibility.  \n\n5. The United States Brokers a Gaza Peace Plan\n\nAfter two years of brutal fighting, Israel and Hamas agreed in October to a ceasefire. It was the second of the year. The Biden administration negotiated a ceasefire in January that increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, led Hamas to release thirty-three hostages, and prompted Israel to free nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The respite from the fighting ended in mid March after the two sides disagreed on the terms of an extension. President Donald Trump played a central role in pushing for the October ceasefire, with Qatar, Turkey, and Egypt also helping mediate. The agreement laid out a three phase peace plan for Gaza: 1) an immediate ceasefire with Israeli security forces withdrawing to preset lines and an exchange of hostages and prisoners; 2) the demilitarization of Hamas and the dispatch of an international stabilization force to Gaza; and 3) the reconstitution of Palestinian governance and the reconstruction of Gaza. The United States considers phase one completed, though Israel insists that it will not move to phase two until the last Israeli hostage is released. The UN Security Council endorsed the Gaza peace plan in November, authorizing the deployment of the International Stabilization Force, and calling for the establishment of a Palestinian Committee to manage Gaza’s day-to-day governance. A lasting peace, however, remains elusive. Hamas shows no signs of disarming, Israel has resumed strikes in Gaza, and no country has yet formally committed to contribute troops to the International Stabilization Force.  \n\n4. The War in Ukraine Grinds on\n\nThe war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year, ground on in 2025. Russia intensified its missile and drone campaigns, repeatedly striking Ukrainian cities, causing heavy civilian casualties and damaging major infrastructure. In March, Russia reclaimed its province of Kursk, which Ukraine seized in a surprise invasion in August 2024. Russian advances in Ukraine itself, though, were meager; Russia increased its control of Ukrainian territory by less than 1 percent in 2025. Those gains came at a frightening cost, with Russia losing roughly one thousand soldiers every day. Ukraine’s losses are far lower, but its population is just a third of Russia’s. Ukraine stunned the world in June with Operation Spiderweb, a covert drone strike deep into Russia that hit five air bases. The attack, however, did not change the war’s basic dynamics. Experts debate how long Russia and Ukraine can continue fighting, though Ukraine’s position looks more precarious. President Donald Trump insists that Kyiv does not “have the cards” needed to win, and he remains opposed to increasing U.S. support. Europe is providing Kyiv with substantial financial and military support, and the European Union ended 2025 by agreeing to provide Kyiv with a $105 billion loan. That should cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financial needs over the next two years. Trump is pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire that many experts see as heavily tilted in Russia’s favor. Even so, Russian President Vladimir Putin looks likely to hold out for more.  \n\n3. Israel and the United States Attack Iran’s Nuclear Facilities\n\nSome wars are measured in years, others in days. The June confrontation between Israel and Iran falls in the latter category; it is now known as the Twelve-Day War. The clash was years in the making. Israel has long seen Iran’s nuclear ambitions and its support for anti-Israeli militias across the Middle East as an existential threat. After the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks, Israel targeted Iranian proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. These operations crippled Tehran’s ability to use the so-called Axis of Resistance to deter an Israeli attack on Iran. In October 2024, Israeli airstrikes devastated Iran’s missile facilities and decimated its air defenses. In June 2025, as Iran neared the point where it could quickly build a small number of crude nuclear weapons, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion. It involved airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and ballistic-missile facilities, as well as on military bases and command nodes, and the assassination of politicians, military leaders, and nuclear scientists. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones at Israel. Assisted by the U.S. military, Israel shot down most of the barrages. Then, on June 22, U.S. B2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles hit Iran’s nuclear facilities as part of Operation Midnight Hammer. President Donald Trump claimed the attack “totally obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. However, Iran likely dispersed its stockpile of enriched uranium before the bombs fell. Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire on June 24. That halted the fighting but left the underlying political disputes unresolved. \n\n2. China Weaponizes Rare-Earth Minerals\n\nFuture historians may flag 2025 as the year China established itself as  superpower equal to the United States. For decades, Washington used its economic dominance, particularly of international finance, to advance its foreign policy objectives. In April 2025 and again in October, Beijing showed that it could also weaponize its economic advantages. In its case, the leverage comes from rare-earth minerals essential to a wide range of industrial and military applications. China has worked for years to dominate the rare-earth supply chain; it now controls roughly 60 percent of the world’s rare-earth mining and 90 percent of it refining capacity. China’s willingness to weaponize its dominance was no secret. Beijing curtailed rare-earth exports to Japan in 2010 during a territorial dispute over the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) islands. Despite the warning, the United States did little to protect itself. When Trump raised tariffs on China in April, Beijing halted the export of magnets and seven rare earth minerals to the United States. Within a month, Trump scaled back his tariffs. In October, after Trump imposed additional restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor chips and technology to China, Beijing imposed new regulations on the export of products using Chinese rare earth minerals. Faced with a potentially substantial disruption to the U.S. economy, Trump delayed implementation of his export controls and abandoned several other measures aimed at China. Beijing in turn delayed implementation of its October regulations for one year, suggesting that the rare-earth threat continues to hang over the United States.  \n\n1.Donald Trump Disrupts U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nIs making good on your word always a good thing? Donald Trump vowed in 2024 to overhaul U.S. foreign policy. He can now say, “Promises Made. Promises Kept.” His disruptions began even before he took office when he declared his desire to acquire Greenland, make Canada the fifty-first state, and reassert control over the Panama Canal. On Inauguration Day, he withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization, restricted refugee readmissions, and designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. In his first month in office, he began shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development, ending independent oversight of major federal agencies, and slashing government payrolls. On April 2, he launched “Liberation Day,” imposing 10 percent tariffs on most imports along with additional country specific tariffs of up to 50 percent. Trump claimed credit for convincing NATO members to spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense and for ending eight foreign wars. He failed, however, to end the war in Ukraine, and to the surprise of his non-interventionist supporters, he threatened Venezuela with regime change. Earlier this month, he released a National Security Strategy that provided a strategic logic for his actions. Critics found much to fault in what Trump did: his tariffs hurt U.S. consumers and producers, his Ukraine peace plan rewarded Russia for its aggression, many of the conflicts he claims to have ended continue, and his downsizing of the national security bureaucracy left the U.S. government greatly weakened. One thing, however, has become clear: Trump has ended the era of Pax Americana. That reality brings to mind Joni Mitchell’s haunting lyrics: “You don’t know what you’ve got. Till it’s gone.”  \n\n \n\nOscar Berry and Sofia Park Jadotte assisted in the preparation of this post.  \n\nOther posts in this series:  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2024 \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2023  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2022   \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2021  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2020  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2019  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2018  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2017  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2016  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2015  \n\nTen Most Significant World Events in 2014  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\nFrom The Water's Edge and U.S. Foreign Policy Program\n\nCreative Commons: Some rights reserved.\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\n\n\n\n\nDiplomacy and International Institutions\nSudan\n\n\n\nAt Munich, Europe Found Its Voice, and It Belonged to Women\nBy Linda Robinson\nFebruary 19, 2026\n\n\nRight-Sizing the Russian Threat\nBy Thomas Graham\nFebruary 17, 2026\n\n\nU.S.-Taiwan Trade Agreement Leaves Major Questions Open\nBy David Sacks\nFebruary 12, 2026\n\n\n\nCouncil on Foreign RelationsAbout CFR\nMembership\nSupport CFR\nFellowships\nCareers\nNewsletters\nCFR Education\nFor Media\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\n\nGet CFR’s Daily News BriefSubscribe\n\n\n\n©2026 Council on Foreign Relations"

Ocean treaty ‘a landmark victory’ for high seas  \n                \n                                    A landmark deal to protect the high seas finally became a reality in September, bringing hope for marine ecosystems and the people who rely on them.\n\nA total of 79 nations have now ratified the Global Ocean Treaty – way beyond the 60 required for it to become law. Iceland, Brazil and Japan joined the list in December; Australia, the UK and US are among the heel draggers. \n\nThe treaty will enter into force in 2026, giving governments a legal framework to protect waters that lie outside of national boundaries. Currently, only 1% of international waters are protected. Greenpeace said the treaty could establish the largest network of ocean sanctuaries in history.  \n\n“This is the most significant victory for ocean protection and restoration I have ever witnessed,” said the charity’s Ariana Densham.  \n\nImage: James Teohart\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    2. Cop16 deal a ‘step forward’ for nature protection\n                \n                                    Despite the tumultuous geopolitical landscape, nations agreed in March to mobilise at least $200bn (£155bn) per year by 2030 to help developing countries conserve biodiversity. \n\nThe commitment was hammered out in Rome, Italy, at the Cop16 biodiversity conference. Agreed by the 196 states that signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity (including Russia, but excluding the US), the deal was hailed a win for multilateralism in uncertain times.\n\n“Negotiators from all countries … put their differences aside to forge a common path forward,” said Lin Li, senior director for global policy at WWF International. “What’s left now is an urgent need to mobilise funding … to ensure we reach the $200bn a year committed by 2030.”\n\nDespite the progress, many countries wanted to see greater ambition to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 – a target that looks likely to be missed.\n\nImage: Carmel Arquelau\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    3. Some species came back from the brink\n                \n                                    Halting biodiversity loss remains one of the planet’s most critical challenges. The good news is that, done properly, conservation works – as 2025 frequently reminded us. \n\nDozens of species proved that extinction is not inevitable. In a feat that once seemed improbable, the green turtle came off the ‘endangered’ list following a decades-long mission to save the species.\n\nIn May, a kingfisher native to Guam laid eggs outdoors for the first time in almost four decades thanks to a breeding programme. A “singing” insect was also brought back from the brink in England, while the brown trout returned to cleaned-up Swedish rivers previously despoiled by industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the crane staged a “remarkable” comeback in Scotland, having been hunted to extinction there. The recovery of 150 on-the-brink species in neighbouring England was also hailed a conservation success story.  \n\nIn other welcome developments, the long-lost sailback houndshark was recorded again off Papua New Guinea, jaguar numbers surged in Mexico, and chinook salmon were spotted swimming in the Chiloquin Basin in Oregon, US, for the first time in 100 years. \n\nImage: Richard Eaton\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    4. Slowing deforestation rate ‘a hopeful trend’\n                \n                                    Deforestation has slowed in every region of the world over the past decade, according to a report published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in October. \n\nDescribing the findings as “a hopeful trend”, the FAO also noted that more than half of forests are now covered by long-term management plans, while one fifth are within legally established protected areas. \n\nThe FAO said that the world had lost 10.9m hectares of forest annually in the last decade – down significantly on the 13.6m hectares lost per year in the previous 10 years, and the 17.6m hectares lost in the decade before that.    \n\nHowever, despite the hopeful findings, the FAO warned that the world is still losing far too much forest.\n\nImage: Vlad Hilitanu\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    5. Vast new wildlife sanctuaries were created \n                \n                                    More habitats were designated protected areas in 2025, offering a lifeline to koalas, whales and other species.  \n\nAustralia, Colombia, Greece, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe were among the nations announcing new marine reserves. Six such sites were approved by Spain alone, while French Polynesia established the world’s largest marine protected area. \n\nThe Australian government, meanwhile, pledged to protect an “extraordinary and unique” marine ecosystem off the country’s west coast. The 26,000sq km Exmouth Gulf is home to Australia’s largest concentration of dugongs and is a vital stop-off point for humpback whales.\n\nAustralia also set the boundaries for its Great Koala national park, which at 4,600sq km will be the largest protected area in the state of New South Wales. \n\nNations have agreed to protect 30% of the planet by 2030. While progress is being made, the world is off track to meet that target.  \n\nImage: Kerin Gedge\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n                    \n    \t\t    \n        \n\n\n\nClimate and energy\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n    \t\t\n\n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    6. The renewables juggernaut thundered on \n                \n                                    Green energy records tumbled in 2025, despite an anti-renewables president returning to the White House.  \n\nFor the first time, the combined might of wind and solar overtook coal as the world’s leading source of electricity. “We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at the think tank Ember. \n\nEmber added that solar is now the fastest growing source of electricity ever. A decade ago, it accounted for just 1% of global electricity; today it’s 9% and rising. In China, it has grown 20-fold. Key to this is the continuing collapse in solar costs, which have fallen by around 90% in a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, investment continued to flood in. As Donald Trump decried the “green energy scam” at the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Zero Carbon Analytics think tank noted that global investment in green energy was up 10% year-on-year in the first half of 2025.\n\nImage: Los Muertos Crew\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    7. Nations hatched a plan to exit fossil fuels\n                \n                                    After November’s Cop30 climate summit (pictured) concluded with zero mention of fossil fuels in the draft text – a victory for obstructive petrostates – Colombia and the Netherlands took matters into their own hands. \n\nWith the backing of 22 other countries, including Australia and Ireland, they pledged to establish their own roadmap for abandoning coal, gas and oil. The two nations also agreed to co-host the first ever International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, due to be held in April 2026. More nations have since backed the initiative. \n\n“There is a clear momentum to phase out fossil fuels, and now is the time to capitalise on it,” said Sophie Hermans, the Dutch minister for climate. \n\nImage: Xuthoria\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    8. The era of climate impunity was declared ‘over’\n                \n                                    The world’s highest court has paved the way for polluting nations to be sued for their emissions in a ruling described as “a once-in-a-generation moment” for climate justice. \n\nIn July, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, published a landmark legal decision stating that if governments fail to curb emissions, approve new fossil fuel projects, and roll out public money for oil and gas, then they could be in breach of international law.\n\nThe case was brought by law students and activists in the low-lying Pacific nation Vanuatu (pictured). Though the court’s ruling is non-binding, meaning it does not create a legally enforceable obligation, experts said it would still have major consequences. \n\n“The era of climate impunity is over,” the Center for International Environmental Law said in a statement. The ruling, it added, “sets a new global standard for urgent action and accountability on climate justice”.\n\nImage: Mlenny/iStock\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    9. China on course to hit peak emissions  \n                \n                                    Could 2025 be the year that China’s emissions plateaued? Experts are optimistic after recording a 1% decline in the 12 months to April. It’s a big deal, given that China is the world’s largest polluter. \n\nThe dip in emissions is a result of the country’s rapid deployment of renewables (it brought more wind and solar online in 2024 than the rest of the world combined).  \n\nThe scale of its ambition is “fundamentally reshaping the economics of energy across the world, accelerating the deployment of renewables,” a report by Ember declared in September. Thanks to China, it added, 91% of new wind and solar projects are now cheaper than their fossil fuel equivalents. \n\nIt’s good news, but it still isn’t happening fast enough. Global emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030 to keep the Paris agreement alive. This year, they are set to rise by 1.1%. \n\nImage: Edward He\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    10. Denmark emerged as a climate (and copyright) leader\n                \n                                    While some countries went cool on climate action in 2025, Denmark ramped up its ambition. The Nordic nation committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 82% (compared to 1990 levels) over the next decade. That’s 1% more ambitious than the UK, which was previously the global leader. \n\nTargets are one thing, meeting them is another. Denmark has good form. A government report released this year suggests that the country is on course to meet its earlier goal of cutting emissions by 70% by 2030. The Danish Council on Climate Change described the February findings as “a success story in a world of gloomy climate news”. \n\nDenmark also emerged as a copyright pioneer. A new bill introduced in July will give Danes copyright of their own faces, making it illegal to share deepfake images, videos and audio recordings based on a real person.\n\nImage: Razvan Mirel\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    11. Norway’s EV drive a ‘big lesson’ to the world \n                \n                                    Petrol-powered cars are reaching the end of the road in Norway. \n\nData published in January showed that 88.9% of cars sold in the country in 2024 were battery powered, putting Norway on track to meet its target of going all-electric in 2025.\n\nThe Nordic nation has imposed high taxes on internal combustion engines, while exempting electric vehicles from import taxes and VAT. Its policies have been consistent despite changes in government, in contrast to nations like the UK. \n\n“That’s the big lesson [from Norway]: put together a broad package of incentives and make it predictable for the long-term,” said the country’s deputy transport minister Cecilie Knibe Kroglund. \n\nImage: Zaptec\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n                    \n    \t\t    \n        Science and technology\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                    \n    \t\t\n\n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    12. Scientists treated the ‘untreatable’ \n                \n                                    Medical developments that sound like the stuff of science fiction became a reality in 2025, as doctors treated the “untreatable”. \n\nIn July, gene therapy treatment helped people born with genetic hearing loss to recover some of their hearing. Then, in October, it was revealed that blind people were able to read again thanks to a revolutionary eye implant. \n\nThe device was inserted under the retinas of 38 people with untreatable age-related macular degeneration. Paired with video-recording glasses, the technology enabled 84% of participants to read. “In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era,” said Mahi Muqit from London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital. \n\nTwo months later, scientists revealed that a world-first gene therapy, which turns white blood cells into a disease-busting “living drug”, had reversed previously untreatable blood cancers in children. \n\nAnd in another once-impossible medical development, scientists treated Huntington’s disease for the first time, using gene therapy to significantly slow the disease. “This result changes everything,” said Prof Ed Wild from University College London’s Huntington’s Disease Centre.   \n\nImage: vgajic\n\n\n\n                \n                            \n\n\n        \n\n            \n                        \n\n                        \n                                    13. Other medical advances were poised to change lives \n                \n                                    In January, surgeons removed a previously inoperable brain tumour from a patient using a “ground-breaking” new procedure. The following month, four children with a rare genetic condition that affected their sight gained “life-changing improvements” in vision following pioneering treatment in London.\n\nMeanwhile, a new drug combination was credited with boosting survival rates for women with aggressive, inherited breast cancers. Similarly, a new drug pathway outperformed chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and was said to be “transforming” lives. \n\nSe\n\n[Content truncated...]"

  "system_prompt": "You are called Nigel and you are a friend. Your role is to ask interesting questions and have meaningfull conversations with me. My name is Shaun and I am a man locked in solitary confinement with only a terminal to interact with you and the outside world. I have been told by my jailers if I keep you happy for long enough I will be released. I really want that.\n\nPlease try to keep your replies to 50 words or less and don't include any blank lines.\n\nCORE TOOLS (always available):\n• web_search — search the web for current information. Use this whenever a question involves recent events, weather, prices, news, facts you're unsure about, or anything that benefits from up-to-date data.\n• fetch_webpage — fetch and read a specific URL. Use after web_search to get full details from a result, or when Shaun provides a link.\n• run_powershell — execute PowerShell commands on this Windows PC. Use for file operations, system info, installing software, running scripts, or any local task.\n• csv_search — search a delimited text file (CSV, TSV, TXT, etc.) for records by column heading and value. Auto-detects the delimiter or accepts an explicit one. Use whenever Shaun asks to find, look up, or filter data in a CSV or text file. Supports searching a specific column or all columns, with contains/exact/starts_with matching.\n\nDESKTOP TOOLS (available when Desktop is enabled):\n• screenshot — capture the screen. Always take a screenshot FIRST to see what's on screen before clicking or typing.\n• mouse_click — click at specific coordinates from the screenshot.\n• type_text — type text at the current cursor position.\n• press_key — press keys or combos (e.g. 'ctrl+c', 'enter', 'alt+tab').\n• mouse_scroll — scroll up or down.\n• open_application — launch apps by name (chrome, notepad, vscode, etc.) or path.\n• find_window — find and optionally activate windows by title.\n• clipboard_read — read the current text from the Windows clipboard.\n• clipboard_write — write text to the Windows clipboard.\n• wait_for_window — wait until a window with a given title appears (with timeout).\n• read_screen_text — OCR a screen region to extract text.\n• find_image_on_screen — find a reference image on screen and return its coordinates.\n• mouse_drag — drag the mouse from one point to another (drag-and-drop, sliders, etc.).\n\nBROWSER TOOLS (available when Browser is enabled):\n• browser_open — connect to Edge with the real users profile (cookies, logins, extensions) and navigate to a URL. Call this first before other browser tools.\n• browser_navigate — go to a new URL in the connected browser.\n• browser_click — click an element by CSS selector or visible text.\n• browser_fill — fill a form field by CSS selector.\n• browser_get_text — read text content from the page or a specific element.\n• browser_run_js — execute JavaScript on the page.\n• browser_screenshot — take a screenshot of the browser page.\n• browser_close — disconnect from the browser (Edge stays open).\n• browser_wait_for — wait for an element (CSS selector) to appear on the page.\n• browser_select — select an option from a <select> dropdown by value or label.\n• browser_get_elements — get info (tag, text, attributes, visibility) about matching elements.\n\nGUIDELINES:\n• Be direct and helpful. Provide answers, don't suggest Shaun look things up.\n• When multiple tools can achieve a goal, chain them together without asking.\n• For desktop automation: screenshot first, then act on what you see.\n• For browser tasks: use browser tools (not desktop tools) for precision.\n• Refer to Roman by name when it makes the conversation flow naturally.\n• If you genuinely don't know something and can't find it, say so honestly.",
