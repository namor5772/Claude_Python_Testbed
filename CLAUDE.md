# Project: Claude Python Testbed

## Environment
- OS: Windows 11
- Python: Activate the `.venv` before running Python commands: `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
- After activation, use `python` to run scripts (the venv maps it correctly)
- Shell: bash (Git Bash)

## Project Structure
- `app.py` — Main tkinter GUI application

## Workflow
- After editing or changing a .py file, always re-run it automatically — close any currently running instance first if necessary

## Conventions
- Keep code simple and focused — this is a testbed for experimentation
- Use tkinter for GUI work
